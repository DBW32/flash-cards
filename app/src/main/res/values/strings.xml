    <string name="about_text">Please Be You hopes to share some important values and concepts of self-love with children, that can help foster self-esteem and resilience in kids.\n\nThe digital age has opened us up to a whole new world.  Social media creates unrealistic body image, social and lifestyle expectation, causing low self-esteem and feelings of loneliness and anxiety.  Tangential to this is an increase in cyberbullying, where victims under the age of 25 are more than twice as likely to self-harm and enact suicidal behaviour than other demographics.\n\n
        We strongly believe now, more than ever, is a time for us to teach children and young people about self-love and values in order for them to appreciate their self-worth, accept themselves for who they are, and feel confident, just as they are.\n\n
        Using a fundamental childhood experience of learning the ABCs is a great way to instill these important values and concepts of self-love in our children.\n\n
        Why not tell kids E is for Empathy instead of E is for Egg, or F is for Fearless instead of F is for Fish?\n\n
        This is an ABC app with a difference.\n\n
        We hope that while facilitating an essential linguistic skill, the earlier kids learn to understand how to love themselves, empathize with others, have an open-mind and so on, the more these concepts will become a lifelong attitude and mindset, and the better they will be equipped as they grow up."</string>
